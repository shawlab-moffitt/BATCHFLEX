}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Numeric matrix after pre-processing with features as rownames and sample names as the column names}

\item{batch_correction}{Numeric matrix following batch correction with features as rownames and sample names as the column names}

\item{meta}{Data frame of sample data with the first column being sample names that match the column names of the matrix}

\item{batch.1}{Column name from the meta file of the column that will be used for batch information}

\item{variable_of_interest}{Column name from the meta file of the column that will be used for the variable of interest information}

\item{ncomponents}{Used by the multiple components plot to select the number of principal components that will be plotted. Default is set to 5}

\item{color_by}{Used by the multiple components plot to select whether "batch" or "variable_of_interest" will be used to color the individuals. Default is set to "batch"}
